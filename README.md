# Emergency-Vehicle-Rooting
This project assigns emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks, police units) to emergency sites (accidents, fires) by modeling the situation as a bipartite graph and applying the Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm for optimal matching â€” ensuring that as many emergencies as possible are handled within the allowed response time.
